    <p>The CSS pixel—denoted in CSS with the suffix px—is a unit of length which roughly corresponds to the
        width or height of a single dot that can be comfortably seen by the human eye without strain, but is
        otherwise as small as possible.<br><br><br><br><br>That definition, of course, leaves a lot of wiggle room, as the terms "be
        comfortably seen" and "an arm's length away" are imprecise, varying from person to person. <br><br><br><br>When a user
        is sitting at a desk in front of a desktop, the display is generally substantially farther away from
        their eyes than when they're on a cell phone, for instance.
